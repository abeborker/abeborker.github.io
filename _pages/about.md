**Hello!**  Things on this website fall into three categories
<p> <b>Teaching</b> - Training the next generation of scientists and conservation leaders, and researching inquiry based pedagogy
<p> <b>Research</b> - I enjoy answering useful questions that can help us protecting biodiversity.  I'm really keen on soundscapes and biodiviersity monitoring improvements to drive more positive conservation outcomes.
<p> <b>Multimedia</b> - I like to take pictures, and tell stories with multimedia.  One day I'll organize it on to this website!  In the meantime here's a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/d1hXL6PAeRPsiBH37">gallery of some of my wildlife photography </a>, and pictures of Antarctic <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/XoL5auKH9mZe6Yem7">birds</a>, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/xNG7zHKgsgyMQF628">mammals</a> and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KMKsVxezwwG52vJ49">landscapes</a>.  Oh and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/B6KVCwHTnC3wTpx89">plankton</a>, because they are amazing.
