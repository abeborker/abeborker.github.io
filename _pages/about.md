Hi there.  Things on this website fall into three categories
<ul>
  <li>**Teaching** - Training the next generation of scientists and conservation leaders, and researching effective approaches </li>
  <li>**Research** - Broadly interested in useful applied research that informs protecting biodiversity</li>
  <li>**Media** - I like to take pretty pictures, and tell stories with multimedia</li>
  <li>**Everything Else** - That's the point of a personal website right?  Recipes and more.</li>
</ul>
