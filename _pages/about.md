**Hello!**  Things on this website fall into three categories
<p>**Teaching** - Training the next generation of scientists and conservation leaders, and researching inquiry based pedagogy</li>
<p>**Research** - I enjoy answering useful questions that can help us protecting biodiversity.  I'm really keen on soundscapes and biodiviersity monitoring improvements to drive more positive conservation outcomes.</li>
<p>**Multimedia** - I like to take pretty pictures, and tell stories with multimedia</li>
<p>**Everything Else** - That's the point of a personal website right?  Natural history musings, recipes and more.</li>
