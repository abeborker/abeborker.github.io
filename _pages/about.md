**Hello!**  Things on this website fall into three categories
<p> <b>**Teaching**</b> - Training the next generation of scientists and conservation leaders, and researching inquiry based pedagogy
<p> **Research** - I enjoy answering useful questions that can help us protecting biodiversity.  I'm really keen on soundscapes and biodiviersity monitoring improvements to drive more positive conservation outcomes.
<p> **Multimedia** - I like to take pretty pictures, and tell stories with multimedia
<p> **Everything Else** - That's the point of a personal website right?  Natural history musings, recipes and more.
