**Hello!**  Things on this website fall into four categories
<p> <b>Teaching</b> - Training the next generation of scientists and conservation leaders, and researching inquiry based pedagogy
<p> <b>Research</b> - I enjoy answering useful questions that can help us protecting biodiversity.  I'm really keen on soundscapes and biodiviersity monitoring improvements to drive more positive conservation outcomes.
<p> <b>Multimedia</b> - I like to take pretty pictures, and tell stories with multimedia
<p> <b>Everything Else</b> - That's the point of a personal website right?  Natural history musings, recipes and more.
